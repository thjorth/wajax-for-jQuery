	<h1>wajax for jQuery demo</h1>
	
	<p>
		<em><strong>Important:</strong> To try this demo you need to have a local webserver setup and serving files 
		from the folder into which you have cloned this repository.</em>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To demonstrate the wajax extension let's first load four chapters of a fictional book into the box below using regular
		ajax. We'll do so by creating four ajax requests - one for each chapter like this:
	</p>
	
	<script src="https://gist.github.com/1031162.js?file=gistfile1.js"></script>
	
	<p>
		Go ahead. Press the first button. Now if you're running Chrome you might always get the chapters in the correct order
		but try firing up Safari or Firefox instead and see what happens. You will most likely get <em>Chapter One</em>
		inserted at the end as it has been weighed down with a huge html comment. 
	</p>

	<button id="ajaxLoad">Load book with ajax (scroll down to see the result)</button>
	<hr/>
	
	<p>
		The second button is using wajax for loading in the four chapters. The click handler for that button looks like this:
	</p>
	
	<script src="https://gist.github.com/1031196.js?file=gistfile1.js"></script>
	
	<p>
		Notice that the only difference is that we're using $.wajax instead of $.ajax and that once all the requests have been
		started a call to <em>$.wajax("go")</em> is made. This instructs wajax that all the needed requests have been started
		and that we're ready to process the callbacks. It's possible to add an optional function parameter after the <em>"go"</em>
		string of a final callback that is executed once all the other callbacks have been processed in order.
	</p>
	
	
	<button id="wajaxLoad">Load book with <strong>wajax</strong></button>
	
	<hr/>
	
	<div id="book">
	
	</div>
	
	<h2>Explanation</h2>
	<p>
		This example demonstrates getting four chapters of a book with four different ajax reques
		ts. The first button will
		fetch the four chapters using regular ajax which means that there's no guarantee in which order the individual ajax requests
		will complete. This is off course the correct behavior and what puts the 'Asynchronous' into Ajax. However, there's also no 
		guarantee of the order in which the different callbacks area invoked. This makes it more difficult to append the content
		in the right order.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second demonstrates getting the same four chapters using wajax. All requests are still startet the moment you call the
		wajax method and subsequent wajax requests are also executed in parallel. Just like with normal ajax requests there is no 
		guarantee in which order the individual requests are completed. The difference is that the callbacks are all executed
		in the order in which the requests were made. In other words the callbacks are postponed until requests are complete.
	Â¨</p>
	<p>
		This off course not meant to replace all existing ajax usages. The example on this page is also a constructed example and
		I'm in no way suggesting this is the smartest way to solve this particular 'problem'. What I am suggesting is that there
		are situations where the wajax behavior is beneficial. For instance if you want to build a page (or part of a page) where
		data form several ajax requests need to be available before building. This also opens up for the possibility of loading
		page/widget templates and data using seperate ajax requests.
